# Lab: Explore the Core eDiscovery workflow

## Lab scenario
In this lab you will go through the steps required for setting up Core eDiscovery and then go through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query, and then exporting the results of the search.  Note:  Licensing for Core eDiscovery requires the appropriate organization subscription and per-user licensing. If you aren’t sure which licenses support core eDiscovery, visit Get started with Core eDiscovery.


**Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes

#### Task 1:  To access Core eDiscovery or be added as a member of a Core eDiscovery case, a user must be assigned the appropriate permissions. In this task, you as the global admin, will add specific users as members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.

1.	Open Microsoft Edge. In the address bar enter **admin.microsoft.com**.

For this lab lab, we will add members to the eDiscovery Administrator sub-group. Select **Edit**, next to eDiscovery Administrator.  As a general best practice, users should be assigned the least privilege required for their role.

1. Close all the tabs except the **admin.microsoft.com** and then sign out from the admin center page and sign-in back again to reflect the permissions added for users faster.

#### Task 2:  In this task you, as an eDiscovery Administrator (Odl_user_id admin is an eDiscovery administrator), will create a case to start using Core eDiscovery.

1. As the creator of the case and because you have eDiscovery Administrator privileges, you can begin to work with it.  

1. Keep this browser tab open, as you will use it in the subsequent task.

#### Task 3:  Now that you have created a Core eDiscovery case, you can begin to work with the case.  In this task, you will create an eDiscovery hold for the case for you just created.  Specifically, you will crate a hold for the the exchange mailbox belonging to Adele Vance.

#### Task 4:  With a hold in place, you will create a search query.  Once your search is complete you will go export and download the results for future investigation.   Note:  Searches associated with a Core eDiscovery case are not listed on the Content search page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. These searches are listed only on the Searches page of the associated Core eDiscovery case.

#### Review

In this lab you went through the steps required to get started with core eDiscovery, including setting up the role permissions for eDiscovery and creating an eDiscovery case.  With the case, created you went through the Core eDiscovery workflow, by creating an eDiscovery hold, creating a search query, and then exporting the results of the search to use further investigation.
