1. Select the **X** on the top-right corner of the screen to close the page and return to the Security Center Overview page. 
1. Keep the Security center overview page open, you will use in the next task.


#### Task 2: In this task you will navigate to Azure Secure score and explore recommendations that can improve your secure score.

> ❗ Important: <br>
> Azure Security Center takes time to populate information such as secure score, compliance, recommendations etc. after enabling the services and enrolling the servers to security center. Sometimes, it can take up to 3 hrs. or even more than that for all the tiles on the overview page to update. if it takes more time, attendees can skip the steps of task 2 & proceed with the Task 3 and can come back later and check on this. We are looking at various approaches to optimize this experience for future workshops.

1. From the Security center overview page, select the **Secure Score** card.

2. From the recommendations page, select **Manage access and permissions**. Notice that there is one item in that group that is red.
3. Select the item **There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription**, which shows the resource health status as red. If selecting selecting this item does not work.
    1. From the top-left corner of the page, select **Security Center**, above where it says Recommendations.    
    1. From the left navigation panel, select **Recommendations**.
